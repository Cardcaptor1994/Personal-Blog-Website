<p class = "p1"><b><u>Steps for making Chicken Biryani</u></b></p>
<ol>
<li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate overnight. Marinating it longer lends for a tender and flavorful chicken.</li>
<li>Heat 3 tbsp of ghee and oil in a pot over medium-high heat. When it sizzles, add marinated chicken pieces gently inside. Saute and fry uncovered for about 5 minutes. Then cover and cook until the chicken is fully cooked. This will take about 20 minutes. Every few minutes open the lid and check that it does not brown or scorch the bottom. IF the chicken is too dry, add ½ cup of water, this should not be too liquidy once it's fully cooked.</li>
<li>While the chicken is cooking, bring a big pot of water to a boil. Add oil, black cumin seeds and salt. Add the rice and do not mix it. Let it boil and cook for 8-10 minutes. It will be almost cooked, but not fully cooked. It should hold the shape, when you crush a rice grain with your finger tips, it should break and crush a tiny bit. <b>DO NOT LET IT SOFTEN TOO MUCH</b>.</li>
<li>Once the rice is cooked 8 minutes, take it out and drain it in a colander immediately. Set aside.</li>
<li>Use the same large pot to layer. Add the cooked chicken, rice, ¼ cup of fried onions and half of the chopped cilantro mint, add another half of the chicken layer, fried onions, cilantro and mint. Top it with rice, dash of ghee and cover with a lid and leave it to simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>If you are worried it will scorch the bottom, keep a griddle/tava or a flat pan. Place the biryani pot on it and simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Wrap the top with a towel so the steam doesn't escape.</li>
<li>Switch off the flame after 10 minutes and let it rest for 20 minutes before you serve.</li>
<li>Serve hot with raita</li>
